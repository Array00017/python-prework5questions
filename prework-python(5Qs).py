#First Question (1st)

# Question 1 write a function to print "hello_USERNAME" is the input of the function 
# The first line of code has been defined as below def hello_name(user_name)

print("first question answer below this line of code")

def hello_name(user_name)
    print("hello_" + user_name)
    print(hello_name("USERNAME!"))

    
    #Second Question (2nd)
    
    #Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing def first_odds():

    def first_odds():
        x = 0 
        while x < 100 
        if x != 0 or == 2 
        return x 
    print(first_odds())

    #Thrid Question (3rd)
    #Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below. def max_num_in_list(a_list):
    
    def max_num_in_list (a_list):
        num_list = [10,19,28,30,55]
          x = 0 
        while x < a_list 
       new_nums = x[i]
    if x[i] > x[i]

    return x[i]

print(max_num_in_list(num_list))
       

    #Fourth Question (4th)
    #Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false). def is_leap_year(a_year):

    def is_leap_year(a_year):
    if a_year % 4 == 0 or a_year % 100 and 400
return true 
else 
return false 


#Fifth Question (5th)
#Write a function to check to see if all numbers in the list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean Type. def is_consecutive(a_list):

def is_consecuitive(a_list): 
    i = 0 
    while i < a_list.length 
    return a_list < i and != a_list < i or a_list.range[2]
